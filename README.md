## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I played around with different ways of nesting styles using SCSS includes and mixins. I'm still trying to determine how I like to organize my styles so that they are easier to look at. They certainly still need to be refactored a bit.

### Continued development
I'm interested in learning how to simplify grid layouts. I feel that I am too hands on with how to make things wrap in particular ways, rather than creating a flexible layout from the start.
